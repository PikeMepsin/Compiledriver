# Compiledriver
An initially private repository for completing work in CMPT432 Compilers

Source language: Java
Author: Michael Pepsin

To compile and run code from this repo:
1. Using Git Bash, clone my repository using the command
"git clone http://github.com/PikeMepsin/Compiledriver.git"

2. Navigate to the project or lab directory in your command shell

3. Use the command "javac filename.java" to compile the program

The next step may change once I have an understanding of the labs/projects specifically.

4a. If the program has a file input or test case, run it with this command
"java filename < inputfile.extension"

4b. If the program doesn't require input (like lab0), use
"java filename"
